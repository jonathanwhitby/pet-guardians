                    <p class="lead">We provide a professional and reliable dog walking services.</p>
					<p>Dogs require physical and mental stimulation.  It energises their body, mind and spirit.  Some behavioural problems can be the result of bored 
					dogs and we would like to help you ensure this is not the case with your dog.  Are you out all day at work?  Perhaps you just need extra help with 
					your dog?  We can offer your dog something they can look forward to every day.</p>

					<p>Your dog will collected from your home, place of work or wherever you choose.  We will transport them safely in our unmarked vehicle to walk in 
					some of the beautiful nearby woodlands, ponds and canals. Once there they will be able to play and socialise with other dogs and you can be assured 
					that your dog is having lots of fun!  Your dog will be secure and safe at all times. We will allow them to socialise with other dogs because we 
					believe this is great for their development and encourages good behaviour and stimulation.</p>
					
					<p>Our walking ratio will not exceed four dogs to a walker.  We will always try to ensure the group of dogs being walked is planned around their 
					temperament and tolerance of other dogs.  However, if you prefer, we are able to walk your dog on a one to one basis.  We will always make sure 
					that your dog will walk in a relaxed happy environment.</p>
					
					<p>For the dogs we walk on a regular basis we will vary their walks to keep things as interesting and stimulating for them as possible.  We do also 
					appreciate that you want your best friend to have lots of fun which might involve playing in mud and puddles.  If this occurs we will endeavour to 
					wipe down and towel dry your dog so that they do not shake off the mud and water in your home.</p>

					<p>Hello, I am Vicky Whitby, co-founder and owner of Pet Guardians of Fleet.</p>
						
					<p>I set up the business in 2015 with my friend Alison Nicoll out of a shared love of animals.  Alison left the business in 2016 just before emigrating to New Zealand.</p>
					
					<p>The happiness and wellbeing of an animal is my focus when doing a job and I promise to always give the best care possible
					to your pet.</p>
					
					<p>During my childhood and young adult years my family and I owned a German Shepherd cross, a pure breed German Shepherd
					and a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross.  I also enjoyed caring for my family's rabbits, chicken and cat.</p>
					 
					<p>Once married my husband and I adopted a Collie called Bess and a Collie cross named Dale.  Sadly Bess died in 2015 aged 16. Dale is now 11 years old and joins me for most group walks.</p>
					 
					<p>Over the years I have cared for Guinea Pigs, budgies, Cockatoos, frogspawn and Pygmy Hedgehogs.</p>
					 
					<p>I have attended dog training classes including animal obedience and canine first aid.</p>
					
					<p>I hope that I am able to help you in the care of your pet and look forward to meeting you and your animals.</p>
