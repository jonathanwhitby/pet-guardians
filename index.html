                                    <p>Dogs require physical and mental stimulation.  It energises their body, mind and spirit.  Some behavioural problems can be the result of bored 
                                        dogs and I would like to help you ensure this is not the case with your dog.  Are you out all day at work?  Perhaps you just need extra help with 
                                        your dog?  I can offer your dog something they can look forward to every day.</p>
                    
                                        <p>Your dog will collected from your home, place of work or wherever you choose.  I will transport them safely in our unmarked vehicle to walk in 
                                        some of the beautiful nearby woodlands, ponds and canals. Once there they will be able to play and socialise with other dogs and you can be assured 
                                        that your dog is having lots of fun!  Your dog will be secure and safe at all times. I will allow them to socialise with other dogs because I 
                                        believe this is great for their development and encourages good behaviour and stimulation.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Our walking ratio will not exceed four dogs to a walker.  I will always try to ensure the group of dogs being walked is planned around their 
                                        temperament and tolerance of other dogs.  However, if you prefer, I am able to walk your dog on a one to one basis.  I will always make sure 
                                        that your dog will walk in a relaxed happy environment.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>For the dogs I walk on a regular basis I will vary their walks to keep things as interesting and stimulating for them as possible.  I do also 
                                        appreciate that you want your best friend to have lots of fun which might involve playing in mud and puddles.  If this occurs I will endeavour to 
                                        wipe down and towel dry your dog so that they do not shake off the mud and water in your home.</p>
