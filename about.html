						<p>Hello, we are Alison Nicoll and Victoria Whitby, the founders and co-owners of Pet Guardians of Fleet.</p>
						
						<p>We set up our business in 2015.  We are both married with children.  We have a love of animals and a passion to see animals cared for within a loving
						environment at all times.  The happiness and wellbeing of an animal is our focus when doing a job and we promise to always give the best care possible
						to your pet.</p>
						
						<p>The two of us have extensive experience working with most types of animals.  We have both had the hard, yet fulfilling experience of homing rescue
						dogs and cats.</p>
						
						<p>During Victoria's childhood and young adult years she had the pleasure of sharing her home with a German Shepherd cross, a pure breed German Shepherd
						and a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross.  She also enjoyed caring for the family's rabbits, chicken and cat.</p>
						 
						<p>Once married Victoria adopted a Collie called Bess and Collie cross named Dale.  Dales is now 10 years old.  Sadly Bess died last year aged 16.</p>
						 
						<p>Over the years Victoria has cared for Guinea Pigs, budgies, Cockatoos, frogspawn and Pygmy Hedgehogs.  At present she has regular walks with Collies,
						a chocolate Labrador, a Malamute Husky Poodle cross, a British Bulldog and a terrier cross.</p>
						 
						<p>Alison grew up an array of animals including a Boxer dog, cats, hamsters, gerbils, a budgy, rabbits and rats.  Once married Alison adopted two cats
						which she took to New Zealand.  She returned with four rescue cats and two rescue dogs.  One of those dogs is still with Alison and is now 17 years old.
						The new addition to Alison's family is Levi.  He is a young Golden-doodle.</p>
						 
						<p>Alison currently has the pleasure of caring for and walking a Golden Retriever, a Terrier, a Foxy cross and a Chihuahua cross.</p>
						 
						<p>Both Alison and Victoria have attended dog training classes including animal obedience and behaviour modification.</p>
						
						<p>We hope that we are able to help you in the care of your pet and we look forward to meeting you and your animals.</p>
